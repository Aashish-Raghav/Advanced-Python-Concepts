# Advanced Python Concepts

Welcome!  
This repository is dedicated to exploring advanced concepts in Python programming.  
Each section introduces a new topic, explains its significance, and provides practical code examples to help you master Python at a deeper level.

## 1. Metaclasses

**What are Metaclasses?**  
Metaclasses allow you to control the creation and behavior of classes themselves.  
They are used for advanced patterns such as enforcing singletons, automatic attribute creation, auto-registering subclasses, or debugging class creation.

**What we've covered in code:**

- **Dynamic Class Creation:**  
  Using the built-in `type` metaclass to create classes dynamically.  
  *See: [`MetaClasses/basics.py`](MetaClasses/basics.py)*

- **Singleton Pattern with Metaclass:**  
  Implementing a custom metaclass to ensure only one instance of a class exists (singleton).  
  *See: [`MetaClasses/custom_metaclasses.py`](MetaClasses/custom_metaclasses.py)*

- **Function-based Metaclass:**  
  Using a function as a metaclass to intercept and debug class creation.  
  *See: [`MetaClasses/custom_metaclasses.py`](MetaClasses/custom_metaclasses.py)*

- **Enforcing Coding Standards with Metaclass:**  
  Creating a custom metaclass to enforce naming conventions for class attributes and methods (e.g., constants in UPPER_CASE, methods in snake_case).  
  *See: [`MetaClasses/coding_standards.py`](MetaClasses/coding_standards.py)*

- **Auto-registering Subclasses with Metaclass:**  
  Using a metaclass to automatically register subclasses in a registry for easy lookup and management.  
  *See: [`MetaClasses/auto_registering.py`](MetaClasses/auto_registering.py)*

#### When to Use Metaclasses in Real Projects

**✅ Good Use Cases**
- Framework Development: Creating ORMs, web frameworks, or API libraries where you need to control class creation extensively
- Design Pattern Enforcement: Implementing singletons, registries, or ensuring specific patterns
- Code Generation: Automatically generating methods, properties, or attributes based on class definition
- Validation: Enforcing coding standards or architectural constraints across many classes
- Plugin Systems: Auto-registration and discovery mechanisms

**❌ Avoid Metaclasses When**
- Simple Modifications: Class decorators are sufficient
- One-off Solutions: The complexity isn't justified for single-use cases
- Team Unfamiliarity: When team members aren't comfortable with metaclass concepts
- Debugging Concerns: When the added complexity makes debugging too difficult

**Summary**  
Metaclasses are a powerful but complex feature in Python. They provide ultimate control over class creation but should be used judiciously.  
*"Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99% of users should ever worry about."* — Tim Peters

## 2. Abstract Base Classes

**What are Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)?**  
ABCs are a way to define interfaces in Python. They allow you to specify methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a consistent API and enforcing design contracts.

**What we've covered in code:**

- **Defining Abstract Base Classes:**  
  Using the `abc` module to create abstract classes with required methods.  
  *See: [`AbstractBaseClasses/basics.py`](AbstractBaseClasses/basics.py)*

- **Implementing Concrete Subclasses:**  
  Creating subclasses that implement all abstract methods.

- **Template Method Pattern:**  
  Using ABCs to define a template method that relies on abstract methods for specific steps.

- **Usage Example:**  
  Demonstrating polymorphism by operating on different vehicle types (Car, Bicycle) through a common interface.

- **Abstract Properties:**  
  Using abstract properties and property setters to enforce that subclasses provide specific attributes and their validation logic.  
  *See: [`AbstractBaseClasses/abstract_properties.py`](AbstractBaseClasses/abstract_properties.py)*

- **Resolving Duck Typing with ABCs:**  
  Using abstract base classes to formally define interfaces (e.g., `Flyable`, `Swimmable`) and ensure objects meet expected behaviors, rather than relying on implicit duck typing.  
  *See: [`AbstractBaseClasses/resolve_duck_typing.py`](AbstractBaseClasses/resolve_duck_typing.py)*

- **Plugin Architecture with ABCs:**  
  Designing a plugin system using abstract base classes to enforce a consistent interface for plugins (e.g., `name`, `version`, `initialize`, `execute`, `cleanup`).  
  Demonstrates plugin registration, management, and usage.  
  *See: [`AbstractBaseClasses/plugin_architecture.py`](AbstractBaseClasses/plugin_architecture.py)*
